        question: "What are the identification rules for replacement properties in Dallas, TX?",
        answer: "In Dallas, TX, replacement property identification must follow IRS regulations. You can identify up to three properties without regard to value, or identify multiple properties if their total value does not exceed 200 percent of the relinquished property value, or identify any number of properties if you acquire at least 95 percent of the total identified value. The identification must be in writing, signed by you, and delivered to the qualified intermediary or other party to the exchange by midnight of the 45th day after the relinquished property closing.",

      {
        question: "How does boot affect my replacement property identification in Dallas, TX?",
        answer: "Boot in Dallas, TX refers to cash or non-like-kind property received in an exchange. If you receive boot, it may be taxable. When identifying replacement properties, consider that acquiring replacement property of equal or greater value than the relinquished property helps minimize boot. Mortgage boot occurs when replacement property debt is less than relinquished property debt. We can help you understand boot calculations, but you should consult with your tax advisor for specific guidance on your situation.",

        question: "Can I identify replacement properties outside of Dallas, TX?",
        answer: "Yes, replacement properties can be located anywhere in the United States for Dallas, TX investors. Like-kind property for 1031 exchanges includes real property held for investment or business use, regardless of location. We provide nationwide property identification support to help you find suitable replacement properties across all major markets. The key requirement is that the property qualifies as like-kind real property, not its geographic location relative to your relinquished property.",

      {
        question: "What happens if I miss the 45-day identification deadline in Dallas, TX?",
        answer: "Missing the 45-day identification deadline in Dallas, TX generally disqualifies the exchange, and the transaction becomes a taxable sale. There are no extensions available for the identification deadline. This is why we emphasize early planning and coordination with your qualified intermediary. We recommend beginning the identification process as soon as possible after listing your relinquished property to ensure you have adequate time to evaluate options and meet the deadline.",

While you can identify replacement properties independently, the qualified intermediary must receive the written identification letter by the 45-day deadline.

        question: "What happens if I want to identify more than three properties in Dallas, TX?",
        answer: "If you want to identify more than three properties in Dallas, TX, you would need to use either the 200 percent identification strategy or the 95 percent identification strategy. The three-property rule limits you to exactly three properties. If you identify four or more properties under the three-property rule, the identification may be invalid.

You can acquire one, two, or all three properties, but you must acquire at least one. If you acquire only one property, the other two identifications become irrelevant.

If you acquire replacement properties totaling equal or greater value than your relinquished property with equal or greater debt, you may avoid boot.

        answer: "Fair market value for identified properties in Dallas, TX is typically the purchase price or contract price if under contract, or an appraised value if not yet under contract. The value should be reasonable and supportable. Some investors use purchase contracts, appraisals, or broker opinions of value. The qualified intermediary and IRS may question values that appear inflated.

        question: "What happens if the total identified value exceeds 200 percent in Dallas, TX?",
        answer: "If the total identified value exceeds 200 percent of the relinquished property value in Dallas, TX, the identification may be invalid unless you qualify for the 95 percent rule. Under the 200 percent rule, you must stay within the 200 percent limit. If you exceed it, you would need to either remove some properties from the identification or ensure you acquire at least 95 percent of the identified values, which would qualify under the 95 percent rule instead. We recommend working with your qualified intermediary and tax advisor to ensure your identification strategy complies with IRS requirements.",

However, if you identify exactly three properties, you may prefer the three-property rule which has no value limitation.

The three-property rule limits you to exactly three properties but has no value requirement and no 95 percent acquisition threshold. The 95 percent strategy allows unlimited properties and values but requires acquiring at least 95 percent of identified values.

You cannot mix the three-property rule, 200 percent rule, and 95 percent rule in the same exchange. Your identification letter must follow one strategy.

If you identify properties with very high values or many properties, you must be confident you can acquire at least 95 percent of them within 180 days.

        answer: "An exchange accommodation titleholder in Dallas, TX is a qualified entity that holds title to the replacement property during a reverse exchange. This entity acquires the replacement property before you sell your relinquished property, holds it during the exchange period, and then transfers it to you after you sell the relinquished property. The exchange accommodation titleholder must be a qualified person who is not your agent or related party. Qualified intermediaries often provide exchange accommodation titleholder services or coordinate with entities that do.",

        question: "How long does a reverse exchange take in Dallas, TX?",
        answer: "Reverse exchanges in Dallas, TX must be completed within 180 days of the replacement property acquisition by the exchange accommodation titleholder. This 180-day period includes both the sale of the relinquished property and the transfer of the replacement property to you. The 45-day identification period for the relinquished property also begins when the replacement property is acquired. These deadlines are strict and cannot be extended, so careful planning and coordination are essential.",

        question: "When should I consider a reverse exchange in Dallas, TX?",
        answer: "Reverse exchanges in Dallas, TX may be appropriate when you have identified replacement property that must be acquired before you can sell your relinquished property, when replacement property is available now but your sale may take longer, or when you want to secure replacement property before market conditions change. Reverse exchanges are more complex and costly than forward exchanges, so they should only be used when necessary. We can help you evaluate whether a reverse exchange is appropriate for your situation.",
