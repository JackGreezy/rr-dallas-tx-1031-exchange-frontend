        question: "What milestones are tracked in a 1031 exchange timeline in Dallas, TX?",
        answer: "Key milestones tracked in Dallas, TX exchanges include the relinquished property closing date, 45-day identification deadline, property evaluation completion, identification letter submission, due diligence periods, lender approval, and 180-day acquisition deadline. Our timeline milestone tracking service monitors all these dates and provides alerts and reminders to help ensure you meet each milestone on time. We coordinate with your Qualified Intermediary and other parties to maintain accurate timeline information.",
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if I miss a milestone in my 1031 exchange timeline?",
        answer: "Missing critical milestones like the 45-day identification deadline or 180-day acquisition deadline in Dallas, TX disqualifies the exchange and triggers immediate tax liability. Missing intermediate milestones may delay the process and risk missing final deadlines. Our timeline milestone tracking service provides early warnings and helps coordinate activities to avoid missing milestones. We work proactively to identify potential delays and coordinate solutions before deadlines are at risk.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do identification rules affect timeline milestone tracking?",
        answer: "Identification rules determine how many properties you can identify within the 45-day window in Dallas, TX, which affects timeline planning. Under the three-property rule, you identify up to three properties. Under the 200% rule, you identify unlimited properties up to 200% of value. Under the 95% rule, you identify unlimited properties if acquiring 95% of identified value. Our tracking service helps plan milestones based on your chosen identification strategy and ensures proper documentation timing.",
      },
      {
        question: "What is boot and how does it relate to timeline milestones?",
        answer: "Boot is taxable consideration received in a 1031 exchange in Dallas, TX. Boot occurs when replacement property value is less than relinquished value, or when cash or non-like-kind property is received. While boot doesn't directly affect timeline milestones, identifying and acquiring properties of equal or greater value helps minimize boot. Our timeline tracking helps ensure you have adequate time to identify and acquire suitable properties that minimize potential boot.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can timeline milestones be adjusted if there are delays?",
        answer: "Critical deadlines like the 45-day identification and 180-day acquisition deadlines cannot be adjusted in Dallas, TX or anywhere else. These are strict IRS requirements. However, intermediate milestones like due diligence periods or lender approval timelines may be adjustable through negotiation. Our timeline milestone tracking service helps identify which milestones are flexible and which are fixed, and coordinates adjustments where possible while protecting critical deadlines.",
      },
      {
        question: "How often will I receive updates on my exchange timeline milestones?",
        answer: "Our timeline milestone tracking service in Dallas, TX provides regular updates based on your exchange timeline and proximity to deadlines. You'll receive weekly updates during normal periods, and more frequent updates as deadlines approach. Critical deadline reminders are sent at 30 days, 14 days, 7 days, and daily as deadlines near.
