This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Taxonomy Rationale

This site organizes 1031 exchange services, locations, and property types to support nationwide replacement property identification. Services are grouped into seven categories: Timelines (45/180 day management), Structures (reverse, improvement, DST), Execution (underwriting, coordination), Tax (boot calculation, state coordination), Reporting (Form 8824 support), Property Paths (identification strategies and asset-specific sourcing), and Education (planning consultation). Locations include 22 Dallas metro areas within 30-45 miles plus a nationwide option, avoiding other top 50 US cities as secondaries. Property types cover ten asset classes from multifamily to land, aligned with IRS like-kind rules. The taxonomy prioritizes investor needs for compliant identification within strict deadlines while supporting both local and multi-state exchanges.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
